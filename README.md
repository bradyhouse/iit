This repository contains all assignment source created while completing the [Illinois Institute of Technology's (IIT) Information Technology and Management](http://appliedtech.iit.edu/information-technology-and-management) (ITM) program.  Each directory in this repository contains the source code generated while completing a specific requirement (class) in this program.  I attended IIT as a part time student from January 2010 through December 2015 in order to a bachelor's degree from IIT's school of Applied Technology.  This repository represents nearly 6 years of work.
