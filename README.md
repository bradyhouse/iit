I attended Illinois Institute of Technology's (IIT) as a part time student from January 2010 through December 2015 inorder to earn bachelor's degree from IIT's school of Applied Technology.  This repository represents nearly 6 years of work.  This repository contains all assignment related source code created while completing the [IIT's Information Technology and Management](http://appliedtech.iit.edu/information-technology-and-management) (ITM) program.  Each directory corresponds to a specific class required by this major.
