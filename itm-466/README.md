# ITM466
ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY ITM466 Service-Oriented Architecture - This course covers IT enterprise systems employing web services technologies in SOA and ESB architectural patterns. The student considers SOA which defines and provisions IT infrastructure and allows for a loosely-coupled data exchange over disparate applications participating in business processes. The simplification of integration and flexible reuse of business components within SOA is greatly furthered by ESB. Lab exercises using contemporary tool-kits are utilized to reinforce platform-agnostic course topics.
