ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY ITMD 465/466 - Students learn to create interactive rich internet applications using web development frameworks, applications, and techniques that primarily operate on the client-side. These applications often exhibit the same characteristics as desktop applications and are typically delivered through a standards-based web browser via a browser plug-in or independently via sandboxes or virtual machines. Current software frameworks used to download, update, verify, and execute these applications are addressed as well as writing applications for deployment in these frameworks.
