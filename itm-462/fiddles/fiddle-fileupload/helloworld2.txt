<h3>What if ...</h3>
<p> What if instead of simply paying it, you could plot that ugly credit card bill on google maps?
    Or perform an internet search in bulk by uploading a csv?  These are questions that have inspired the
    Google ETL Interfaces (aka <i>Gooetls</i>).  Although we are still under construction and some disgruntled soul
    has unleashed a <i>raptor</i> on our home page, you are welcome to look around or drop us a note via
    the <a id="index-contactUs" href="#">contact widget</a>.

<p>Thankyou for visiting,</p>
