fiddles
======

Before you can build a website using the Personal Home Page (PHP) language, you have to understand PHP.  Based on books, research, and trial and error, the best approach I have found is to _fiddle_.  If I am unfamiliar with or (simply) donâ€™t understand a specific piece of the language, then step one is to build a fiddle (or fiddles) until it makes sense.  Each of the following sub-directories corresponds to stand alone application that *fiddles* with a specific piece of PHP.
